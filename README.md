# CSS-style-cheatsheet


## Description

My motivation for creating this CSS cheatsheet was to test my newly learned CSS skills and to make an easy guide for myself to refer to in the future. It has easily retrieved copy/paste snippets of code I'll be able to use. On this page I was able to use media queries and the flexbox model to make my page responsive. Also, I was able to use more complex CSS features like pseudo elements and CSS custom features.

I learned that I have a lot more to learn and I plan to keep this CSS page up to date if I learn something new and i'd like to have an easily accesible piece of code.
